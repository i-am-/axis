Coaching as a discipline traces its roots to the ancient Greek philosopher and a decorated military hero Socrates (470-399 BC), who believed in seeking truth through a question-and-answer method known as Socratic dialogue. This approach is fundamental to modern coaching.

A coach acts as a thought partner, guiding clients toward their own solutions by asking powerful questions rather than providing answers. This process of active listening and creating a safe space for self-discovery empowers clients to achieve their personal and professional goals.
