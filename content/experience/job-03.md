At PwC Ireland, I was a Senior Manager leading complex operational effectiveness projects. A key highlight was directing the Order-to-Cash process rollout for Pfizer's Oracle JD Edwards ERP, which included a critical integration with Salesforce. I also spearheaded the implementation of the Camunda Business Process Management system to automate intercompany settlements, which significantly boosted efficiency. My work also involved leading research on the operational impacts of Brexit and contributing to a supply chain risk assessment toolkit for the Irish Food sector.
