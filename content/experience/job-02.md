I led strategic IT initiatives to transform our global supply chain, significantly improving both operational efficiency and the customer experience. A key part of this work involved implementing an "Amazon-like" notification system, which successfully reduced customer inquiries by 20%. I also directed the deployment of a new B2B portal, which streamlined the ordering process by pre-filling 60% of fields and cutting the time to order by 23%. My role also included piloting cutting-edge solutions like using Generative AI to optimize SOPs. Additionally, I drove the adoption of the EDI ordering channel, increasing its use to an average of 15% across EMEA, and improved our call response rates by 18% with a new Salesforce-integrated call center. My work on continuous improvements in SAP ECC also reduced non-value-added time for Customer Operations by 30%.
