I led key IT initiatives to transform the global supply chain, significantly boosting efficiency and the customer experience. By implementing an "Amazon-like" notification system, I reduced customer inquiries by 20%. I also directed a B2B portal deployment that automatically pre-filled 60% of fields, cutting the time to order by 23%. My work included piloting Generative AI for optimizing SOPs and master data. I accelerated the use of the EDI ordering channel, increasing its share to an average of 15% across EMEA. Furthermore, I improved call response rates by 18% with a new Salesforce-integrated call center. Finally, I designed and implemented continuous improvements in SAP ECC, which reduced non-value-added time for Customer Operations by 30%.
