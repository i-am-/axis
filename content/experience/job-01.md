As a Senior Manager at PwC Moscow, I focused on strategic and operational projects that delivered tangible results. I specialized in Supply Chain Network Design and ERP implementations, directly saving clients up to $10 million. A key part of my work involved applying Lean Six Sigma principles to improve efficiency. For example, I successfully increased a feed plant's capacity by 3% through a SMED project. My experience also includes leading Operational Excellence initiatives across the steel, pharmaceutical, and agribusiness industries.
