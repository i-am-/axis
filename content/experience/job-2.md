## Senior Manager

As a Senior Manager at PwC Ireland, I specialized in leading complex operational effectiveness projects. My key achievement was directing a successful international Oracle JD Edwards ERP rollout for the Order-to-Cash process at Pfizer, which included a critical integration with Salesforce. I also spearheaded the implementation of the Camunda Business Process Management system, which automated intercompany settlements and significantly improved efficiency. In addition to these projects, I led research on the operational impacts of Brexit and contributed to a supply chain risk assessment toolkit specifically for the Irish Food Supply Chains.
