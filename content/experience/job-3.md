## Senior Manager

As a Senior Manager at PwC Moscow, I specialized in a range of strategic and operational projects. My work focused on Supply Chain Network Design and ERP implementation, achieving up to $10 million in direct savings for clients. I applied Lean Six Sigma methodologies to drive efficiency, notably increasing a feed plant's capacity by 3% using SMED (Single-Minute Exchange of Dies). Additionally, I conducted Operational Due Diligence for major transactions across the steel, pharmaceutical, and agribusiness sectors.
