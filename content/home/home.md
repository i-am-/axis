    description="<p>Coaching embodies open and honest conversations within a safe, non-judgmental, confidential environment, where the coach asks questions to re-examine feelings, beliefs, assumptions and views to achieve maximum human potential. This journey can be challenging, filled with uncomfortable questions, intense emotions, and significant realisations, but the results are rewarding. Coaching sessions provide a reflective space — an opportunity to pause and think, process emotions, and reconnect the mind, body, and soul.</p><p>Based on your expectations, coaching isn't necessarily the only modality you should explore.</p><small><table class='table table-striped table-hover'><thead><tr><th>Modality</th><th>Focus</th><th>Horizon</th><th>Direction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Coaching</strong></td><td>Future goals and potential</td><td>Now to future</td><td>Client finds answers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mentoring</strong></td><td>Career and personal growth</td><td>Now to future</td><td>Mentor shares wisdom</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Counselling</strong></td><td>Past and present healing</td><td>Past to now</td><td>Therapist provides insight</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Consulting</strong></td><td>Specific problem and solution</td><td>Now to future</td><td>Consultant provides answers</td></tr></tbody></table></small></p><p>A coaching engagement is typically a <em>short-term intervention</em>. You should begin to see progress within a few sessions, though some engagements can last up to ten sessions. If you don't feel you're making much progress after about five sessions, it might be time to consider a different coach or approach.</p><p>The time between sessions is just as important as the sessions themselves. It allows you to complete any homework, process insights, and take action. The ideal space between sessions is two to eight weeks. Any more frequent, and as one of my teachers put it, <quote>coaching becomes coping.</quote></p><p>If you are interested to explore your past, trauma, grief and intense feelings, therapy is a better option to start with. You can find your nearest therapist at the <a href='https://iacp.ie/therapists'>IACP website</a>.</p><p>Your coaching journey begins with a chemistry or discovery call. This initial conversation is for both you and the coach to decide if you're a good fit for one another. You can use this time to better understand the coach's style and to clarify your goals for the engagement. Some coaches may offer a brief test session to help you experience their approach firsthand. It's important to note that, without special clearance, coaches can only work with clients who are 18 or older.</p><p>During your initial chemistry or discovery call, your coach will outline the rules of engagement. This will cover important topics like client agency, creating a safe space, and the principles of confidentiality and ethics. While confidentiality is a core principle, it can be waived if you disclose information that suggests a risk of harm to yourself or others.</p><p>After you and your coach mutually agree to move forward, the coach will provide you with a contract that outlines all the details of your engagement.</p><p>Ready to begin your journey?</p>"
