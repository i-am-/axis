    description="Coaching embodies open and honest conversations within a safe, non-judgmental, confidential environment, where the coach asks questions to re-examine feelings, beliefs, assumptions and views to achieve maximum human potential. This journey can be challenging, filled with uncomfortable questions, intense emotions, and significant realisations, but the results are rewarding. Coaching sessions provide a reflective space â€” an opportunity to pause and think, process emotions, and reconnect the mind, body, and soul."
