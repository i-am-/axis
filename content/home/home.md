    description="<p>It's likely not a coincidence that you've found your way here to Igniting Coach. I'm Ilya Malyarenko, and it's a pleasure to meet you. After spending 15 years as a management consultant and another six in the Biopharma industry, I discovered my true calling: helping others find their way.<p>There's nothing more rewarding to me than mentoring people, guiding them to not only succeed in their careers but also to discover their deeper purpose.</p><p>Now, I'm dedicated to helping individuals like you navigate significant life and career changes. My experience is pretty broad—from leading large-scale digital transformations to working directly with teams to improve their processes using Lean Six Sigma.

    description="<p>Coaching embodies open and honest conversations within a safe, non-judgmental, confidential environment, where the coach asks questions to re-examine feelings, beliefs, assumptions and views to achieve maximum human potential. This journey can be challenging, filled with uncomfortable questions, intense emotions, and significant realisations, but the results are rewarding. Coaching sessions provide a reflective space — an opportunity to pause and think, process emotions, and reconnect the mind, body, and soul.</p><p>Based on your expectations, coaching isn't necessarily the only modality you should explore.</p><small><table class='table table-striped table-hover'><thead><tr><th>Modality</th><th>Focus</th><th>Horizon</th><th>Direction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong><code>Coaching</code></strong></td><td><code>Future goals and potential</code></td><td><code>Now to future</code></td><td><code>Client finds answers</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mentoring</strong></td><td>Career and personal growth</td><td>Now to future</td><td>Mentor shares wisdom</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Counselling</strong></td><td>Past and present healing</td><td>Past to now</td><td>Therapist provides insight</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Consulting</strong></td><td>Specific problem and solution</td><td>Now to future</td><td>Consultant provides answers</td></tr></tbody></table></small></p>"
