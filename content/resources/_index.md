          **The Big Five Personality Test (OCEAN)** is a framework that describes five core personality traits:
          - ```Openness```: Creative and curious vs. conventional and cautious
          - ```Conscientiousness```: Organized and disciplined vs. easygoing and spontaneous
          - ```Extraversion```: Outgoing and energetic vs. solitary and reserved
          - ```Agreeableness```: Compassionate and cooperative vs. competitive and suspicious
          - ```Neuroticism```: Anxious and sensitive vs. confident and emotionally stable

          This model is a valuable tool in coaching because it provides a shared language to...
          - Identify ```strengths``` and ```challenges```
          - ```Tailor strategies```
          - ```Improve self-awareness```

          **The L√ºscher Color Test** is a psychological assessment tool developed by Swiss psychiatrist Dr. Max L√ºscher in 1949. It's based on the idea that while everyone perceives color the same way, individual preferences for colors are unique. This test measures a person's current psychological state, including their ability to handle stress and their capacity for performance and communication. By analyzing a person's color choices, the test aims to uncover the root causes of psychological stress, which may be contributing to physical symptoms.

          This test provides:
          - ```Quick and non-verbal insights```
          - ```Identification of the root causes of stress```
          - ```Highlights "snapshot" of the current needs and motivations```
          - ```A tool for tracking progress over time```

          **Life stress inventory (Holmes-Rahe)**, also known as the **Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS)**, is a psychological tool that quantifies the amount of stress a person has experienced over a specific period, typically the past year. Developed by psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe, the inventory lists 43 life events‚Äîboth positive and negative‚Äîand assigns a "Life Change Unit" (LCU) score to each based on its potential to cause stress and illness. By totaling the scores, a person gets a number that provides a rough estimate of their risk for stress-related health problems.

Based on a comprehensive study of IBM employees worldwide, the model provides a systematic way to compare cultures by analyzing them across six dimensions: Power Distance, Individualism vs. Collectivism, Masculinity vs. Femininity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation, and Indulgence vs. Restraint. This influential theory has been widely applied in various fields, including international business and cross-cultural communication, to help people navigate and understand cultural diversity.
