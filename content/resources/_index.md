## 1.1 The Big Five Personality Test (OCEAN)
[__The Big Five Personality Test (OCEAN)__](https://bigfive-test.com/) is a framework that describes five core personality traits:
- <code>Openness</code>: Creative and curious vs. conventional and cautious
- <code>Conscientiousness</code>: Organized and disciplined vs. easygoing and spontaneous
- <code>Extraversion</code>: Outgoing and energetic vs. solitary and reserved
- <code>Agreeableness</code>: Compassionate and cooperative vs. competitive and suspicious
- <code>Neuroticism</code>: Anxious and sensitive vs. confident and emotionally stable

This model is a valuable tool in coaching because it provides a shared language to...

- <code>Identify strengths and challenges</code>
- <code>Tailor strategies</code>

## 1.2 The Lüscher Color Test
[__The Lüscher Color Test__](https://psytests.org/luscher/lus8en-run.html) is a psychological assessment tool developed by Swiss psychiatrist Dr. Max Lüscher in 1949. It's based on the idea that while everyone perceives color the same way, individual preferences for colors are unique. This test measures a person's current psychological state, including their ability to handle stress and their capacity for performance and communication. By analyzing a person's color choices, the test aims to uncover the root causes of psychological stress, which may be contributing to physical symptoms.

This test provides:
- <code>Quick and non-verbal insights</code>
- <code>Identification of the root causes of stress</code>
- <code>Highlights "snapshot" of the current needs and motivations</code>
- <code>A tool for tracking progress over time</code>


## 1.3 Life Stress Inventory
[__Life stress inventory (Holmes-Rahe)__](https://www.stress.org/self-assessments/holmes-rahe-life-stress-inventory/), also known as the __Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS)__, is a psychological tool that quantifies the amount of stress a person has experienced over a specific period, typically the past year. Developed by psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe, the inventory lists 43 life events—both positive and negative—and assigns a "Life Change Unit" (LCU) score to each based on its potential to cause stress and illness. By totaling the scores, a person gets a number that provides a rough estimate of their risk for stress-related health problems.


## 1.4 Work Stress Inventory
[__The Workplace Stress Scale__](https://www.stress.org/self-assessments/holmes-rahe-life-stress-inventory/) is a tool designed to measure and quantify an individual's level of stress specifically related to their work environment. Unlike broader stress inventories, this scale focuses on factors inherent to the workplace, such as workload, lack of control, support from supervisors and colleagues, work-life balance, and job security.

Work Stress Inventory...
- <code>Identifies Specific Triggers</code>
- <code>Facilitates Targeted Action</code>
- <code>Validates Experience</code>
- <code>Measures Progress</code>

## 1.5 Rockeach Value Survey (RVS)
[__Rockeach Value Survey__](https://ung.edu/center-ethical-leadership/_uploads/files/rokeach-value-survey.pdf) is a psychological instrument developed by social psychologist Milton Rokeach in 1973 to measure an individual's value system. The survey is based on the idea that a person's values are organized into a hierarchical system that guides their behavior and judgments.

- [__Geert Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory__](https://geerthofstede.com/country-comparison-bar-charts/) is a framework developed by the Dutch social psychologist to understand how cultural differences influence behavior and values within societies. Based on a comprehensive study of IBM employees worldwide, the model provides a systematic way to compare cultures by analyzing them across six dimensions: Power Distance, Individualism vs. Collectivism, Masculinity vs. Femininity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation, and Indulgence vs. Restraint. This influential theory has been widely applied in various fields, including international business and cross-cultural communication, to help people navigate and understand cultural diversity.
