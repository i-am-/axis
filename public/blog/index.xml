&lt;p&gt;Coaching is a way to look at your life from the outside in and unveil key roadblocks that are holding you back from realising your full human potential. Imagine yourself as a perfect divine machine. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that all your basic needs are satisfied. You have a shelter, food, a partner, and a decent job. Your key resource is your &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt;.

What are the opportunities to improve the output of your machine?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
